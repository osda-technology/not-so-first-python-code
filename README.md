# not-so-first-python-code

This is my not-so-first python project.

I just learned python intensively 2-3 weeks ago. I joined IBM Data Science Certification in Coursera because I want to transition my career from digital marketing (SEO & FB Ads) to something different.

I viewed programmers have better salary and there are lots of opportunites to work remotely for programmers. Besides, I want to be a programmer years ago but I never take an action.

After several course parts in IBM Data Science Certification, I found that their teachings are not newbie friendly, at least for me. Additionaly, because I was really into to learn remote work things, I joined Indonesian remote workers community (remoteworkid), they offered me a free python course in Udemy.

Within the lattest course, I found the teachings are easier than IBM and this is the first task. Create a repo in organization Github repo.

Thank you for reading this readme file.

Have a nice day.
